# Planning plugin for Sporttracks #
## Plan your activities and compare the plan with your performed activities. ##

This is a plugin for those who use [Sporttracks](http://www.zonefivesoftware.com/sporttracks) as a training analysis tool and want to use standard Sporttracks functionality to enter planned activities but need a way to compare planned and performed activities.

The base is that the user interprets the Sporttracks "My friends activities" category as "My planned activities". By doing so, the user can enter planned activites using the standard user interface, just making sure to choose "My friends activities" or a subcategory thereof for the planned activities. He/she can enter all of the information that is desired for the planned activities just as it can be done for performed activities.

The planned activities can be analyzed using the activity reports view, just as the performed activities can. What standard ST doesn't support is a way to compare the planned and performed activities in a good way. That is where ComparePlanned comes into the picture.

When the user wants to compare the planned activities with performed activites, he/she just chooses the ComparePlanned view, where the list shows both kinds of activities at once. The user can choose the columns that are shown from the context menu. Just right click on the list control (table). Both standard information and custom data fields are supported.

The user can choose to group activities per day, week, month and/or year. Grouping by week is recommended if activities are planned week by week as is common practice. A group sum/average will be shown for the most common data.

The planned and performed activities are shown in the ST calender. Planned activities are shown with a red mark and performed activities are shown as standard in the daily view. The user can click a date in the ST calender and the closest activity will be selected in the Compare Planned view.

It is possible to use the approach described here also with the Garmin Fitness plugin. Just make sure that the workouts are located under the "My friends activities" category and make sure that the "Add to logbook" checkbox is checked before clicking the button to schedule the workout.
